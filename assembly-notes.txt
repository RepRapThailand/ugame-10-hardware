There are some notes for the assembly of this device:

1. The speaker needs to be protected with a piece of tape when the boards are
   washed after soldering, to prevent the fluid entering them.
2. The screen has to be left unattached, so that it's possible to later solder
   the battery without melting the screen's plastic.
3. Care must be taken to make sure the USB socket is straight.
