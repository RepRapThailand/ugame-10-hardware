Testing and Flashing of the uGame 10 Project
********************************************


Prerequisites
=============

* A computer running Linux or Windows.
* A JLink or Atmel-CMSIS programmer.
* Python.
* Adafruit AdaLink software from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Adalink
* JLink Tools software from https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/
* A micro-USB cable.
* The attached bootloader.bin file.
* The attached firmware.uf2 file.
* The attached test.zip file.

Installing the Software
=======================

To install the AdaLink software, the following steps are necessary:

1. Download the code from
   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Adalink/archive/master.zip

2. Unpack the code and enter the directory.
4. Run installation:

    python setup.py develop

5. Add adalink to the system path.

To install the JLink Tools software, the following steps are necessary:

1. Go to https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink
2. Under " J-Link Software and Documentation Pack" click " Click for
   downloads"
3. Download the version more suitable for your system.
4. Run your installer.
5. Make sure the installed software is added to the system path as described at
   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Adalink#install-j-link-tools


Test Procedure
==============


Connecting to the Board
-----------------------

In order to flash the bootloader, it is necessary to connect the JLink
programmer to the four debugging pads on the bottom of the board. The
connections are as follows:

1. GND -- GND
2. SWDIO -- TMS/SWDIO
3. VCC -- VCC/Vref
4. SWDCLK -- TCK/SWCLK

The connections can be easily done by using hook probes, alligator clips or
pogo pins.

It is also necessary to provide power to the board with a USB cable connected
to the board's micro-USB socket during flashing. When the USB cable is
connected, the display will shine white, and the orange LED be on.


Flashing the Bootloader
-----------------------

The attached "bootloader.bin" file needs to be flashed with the Adalink
utility:

    python adalink.py -v atsamd21g18 -p jlink -b bootloader.bin 0

When this command completes, a new USB disk named "TRINKETBOOT" should appear
on the computer to which the board is connected. The disk will contain two
files called "CURRENT.UF2" and "INFO_UF2.TXT".


Flashing the Firmware
---------------------

In order to flash the firmware, it is necessary to copy the file
"firmware.uf2" to the TRINKETBOOT disk that appeared after flashing the
bootloader. When this operation completes, the TRINKETBOOT disk will
disappear, and after a moment a disk called CIRCUITPYTHON should appear. The
disk will contain a single file called "boot_out.txt".


Flashing the Test Program
-------------------------

To flash the test program, the unpacked contents of the attached "test.zip"
 file need to be copied into the CIRCUITPYTHON disk. When this is successful,
the board will reset, and the display will turn all blue. There should be no
bad pixels on the display, all of it should be consistently blue.


Testing the Buttons
-------------------

To finish the testing procedure, each of the six large buttons needs to be
pressed -- every time that happens, a white symbol of that button will be
displayed on the screen, and a sound will be played through the speaker. All
six buttons have to work properly.

Finally the small button marked "reset" should be pressed, which should result
in the board resetting back to the beginning of the test program.


Disconnecting
-------------

The USB cable can be disconnected, and then the programmer cables. The board
is successfully tested at this point.
