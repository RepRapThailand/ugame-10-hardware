µGame 10 Handheld Game Console
******************************

This repository contains the design files for the µGame 10 handheld game
console. As the name implies, this is the 10th prototype in series.

µGame is a game console that is programmable with Python.

To get a fully functional device, you will need to compile and flash the UF2
bootloader and the special CircuitPython firmware. Instructions for that will
be posted separately.
